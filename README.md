This is the Nuxt.js frontend application for the Molecular Solubility Predictor. It provides a user interface to interact with a FastAPI backend, which uses a trained Graph Neural Network (GNN) model to predict the aqueous solubility of chemical compounds based on their SMILES representation.

## Live Demo

**Try it now:** [https://solpred.netlify.app/](https://solpred.netlify.app/)

## Features

- **SMILES Input:** Enter a molecule's structure using its SMILES string.
- **Sample Molecules:** Select from predefined sample molecules for quick testing.
- **Input Validation:** Real-time validation of the entered SMILES string against the backend.
- **Solubility Prediction:** Send the SMILES string to the FastAPI backend to get the predicted solubility value and level.
- **Molecule Visualization:** Displays the 2D structure of the input molecule along with key properties (requires RDKit.js or backend-generated image).
- **Responsive Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS for usability across different screen sizes.

## Technology Stack

- **Framework:** [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/)
- **UI Library:** [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) (Composition API with `<script setup>`)
- **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **API Communication:** Native `fetch` (or `$fetch` via Nuxt) within a composable (`useSolubilityApi`)
- **Molecule Visualization:** Future plan to use [RDKit.js](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/GettingStartedInJS.html) but for now uses images generated by the backend.
- **State Management:** Vue Reactivity (`ref`, `computed`) (Pinia is available but might not be actively used based on review).
- **Linting:** ESLint (using Nuxt ESLint config)

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** Version 18.x or higher (as specified in `Dockerfile`).
- **Package Manager:** npm, pnpm, yarn, or bun.
- **Running Backend API:** The [FastAPI backend](https://github.com/viv-bad/solubility-predictor) for solubility prediction _must_ be running and accessible from the machine where you run this frontend.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/viv-bad/solubility-predictor-webapp
    cd solubility-predictor-webapp
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Choose your preferred package manager:

    ```bash
    # npm
    npm install

    # pnpm
    pnpm install

    # yarn
    yarn install

    # bun
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    The application needs to know the URL of your running FastAPI backend. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Edit the `.env` file and set the `API_BASE_URL` variable:

    ```dotenv
    # .env
    # Example: If the backend runs locally on port 8000
    API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000

    # Example: If the backend is deployed (to be done in near future)
    # API_BASE_URL=https://fastapi-backend.com
    ```

    _Note: If you don't have an `.env.example` file, create the `.env` file directly with the `API_BASE_URL` line._

4.  **Run the Development Server:**
    Start the Nuxt development server. It will usually be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

    ```bash
    # npm
    npm run dev

    # pnpm
    pnpm dev --open # --open automatically opens it in your browser

    # yarn
    yarn dev

    # bun
    bun run dev --open
    ```

## Building for Production

1.  **Build the application:**
    This command compiles the Vue/Nuxt application and creates an optimized production build in the `.output` directory.

    ```bash
    # npm
    npm run build

    # pnpm
    pnpm build

    # yarn
    yarn build

    # bun
    bun run build
    ```

2.  **Preview the Production Build:**
    You can locally serve the production build to test it before deployment.

    ```bash
    # npm
    npm run preview

    # pnpm
    pnpm preview

    # yarn
    yarn preview

    # bun
    bun run preview
    ```

## Deployment

- **Docker:** A multi-stage `Dockerfile` is included in the repository. You can build and run a containerized version of the application:

  ```bash
  # Build the docker image
  docker build -t molecular-solubility-frontend .

  # Run the container (replace 8080 with your desired host port)
  # Make sure to pass the API_BASE_URL environment variable!
  docker run -p 8080:3000 -e API_BASE_URL=http://your-backend-host:8000 --name solubility-frontend molecular-solubility-frontend
  ```

  Access the application at `http://localhost:8080`. *Remember that the `API_BASE_URL` inside the container must point to a URL accessible *from* the container (e.g., using Docker networking or a public URL, not `localhost` unless using host networking).*

- **Static Hosting (if applicable):** If your app doesn't rely heavily on Nuxt server features beyond the initial render, you could potentially generate a static site (`npm run generate`) and host it on platforms like Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc. However, given the dynamic API interaction, the default server build (`npm run build`) is likely more appropriate.

- **Node Server:** Deploy the `.output` directory to any platform that can run a Node.js server (e.g., VPS, Heroku, Render, Fly.io).

Refer to the [Nuxt Deployment Documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment) for more detailed deployment strategies.

## API Backend Requirement

**Important:** This frontend application is purely an interface. It **requires** the corresponding FastAPI backend service to be running and accessible at the URL configured via the `API_BASE_URL` environment variable. All predictions and validations are performed by the backend API.

## Project Structure (Key Directories)

- `assets/`: Global styles (Tailwind entry point), fonts, or images.
- `components/`: Reusable Vue components (e.g., `MoleculeInput`, `PredictionResult`).
- `composables/`: Reusable Vue Composition API functions (e.g., `useSolubilityApi` for backend interaction).
- `pages/`: Application views and routing structure. `index.vue` is the main page.
- `public/`: Static assets directly served (e.g., `robots.txt`).
- `server/`: Nuxt server-side API routes or middleware (if any were added).
- `nuxt.config.ts`: Main Nuxt configuration file.
- `Dockerfile`: For building production Docker images.
